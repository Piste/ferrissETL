For years, I've been studying Stoicism, but I've always had a particular interest in The Tao of Seneca.\u00a0What is the Tao of Seneca? There's a collection of letters called, \"The Moral Letters to Lucilius.\" And I have read this entire collection of letters and other letters of Seneca, the author, probably more than 100 times. It has been my constant companion for at least the last 10 years. And I have given various forms of these letters to more friends than I can even count and several hundred acquaintances -- I feel that strongly about it. So when people ask me about my favorite book, I say this collection of letters.</p> <p>The problem has been there is no good audio edition. So I, for many months now, have made this my passion project to create\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.audible.com/timsbooks\" target= \"_blank\">The Tao of Seneca: Practical Letters from a Stoic Master</a>. Three volumes, and it covers them all. Here's the description:</p> <p><em>The Tao of Seneca is an introduction to the stoic philosophy through the words of Seneca. Thought leaders in Silicon Valley tout the benefits of stoicism, and NFL management (coaches and players, alike) have embraced it because the principles make them better competitors.</em></p> <p>This episode features letter #13, \"On Groundless Fears.\" Stoicism is a no-nonsense philosophical system designed to produce dramatic real-world effects.

I only finally took the plunge when writing <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>, and it turned my eating and my life into high definition. <a href=\"http://foodistkitchen.com/tim\" target= \"_blank\">Foodist Kitchen</a> is a 30-day program that teaches you how to cook without recipes, and I highly recommend it. Chopping and saut\u00e9ing are just a small part of the whole deal -- you also need to know what flavors taste good together and what it means to cook until done.</p> <p><a href=\"http://foodistkitchen.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">Foodist Kitchen</a> brings all these skills together so you can walk into the kitchen, open the fridge, and have an intuitive sense of what to cook and how to do it. It was created by Darya Rose, who's a friend of mine and one of my cooking mentors for <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>. She has offered a $15 discount off your membership, so check out <a href=\"http://foodistkitchen.com/tim\" target= \"_blank\">FoodistKitchen.com/Tim</a> to learn more about the program.</p> <p><strong>This episode is also brought to you by <a href= \"https://www.exoprotein.com/tim\" target=\"_blank\">Exo Protein</a>.</strong> These guys are making protein bars using cricket protein powder.

Mindfulness is something that is difficult and usually overlooked by most people.</p> <p>So why is\u00a0mindfulness essential? When it comes to achievement, most people just work harder. In reality, you want to first achieve more focus and clarity, which can help guide your effort. This is the real benefit of mindfulness. Once you incorporate it into your life, you complain less, appreciate more, react less, and fill your life with what's most important to you.

Wim is an outlier of outliers, as he routinely asks scientists to scrutinize and validate his feats. Here are just a few examples:</p> <ul style= \"color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;\"> <li>In 2007, he climbed past the \u201cdeath zone\" altitude on Mount Everest (~7,500 meters) wearing nothing but shorts.</li> <li>In 2009, Hof completed a full marathon above the polar circle in Finland, in temperatures close to \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F).

The run was performed under the supervision of Dr. Thijs Eijsvogels. He can also run at altitude without suffering from altitude sickness.</li> <li>In the same year, he was injected with toxins under doctor supervision and demonstrated that he could effectively control his autonomic immune response.

Fadiman outlines best practices for safe \"entheogenic\" voyages learned through his more than 40 years of experience--from the benefits of having a sensitive guide during a session (and how to be one) to the importance of the setting and pre-session intention.
